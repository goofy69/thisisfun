            Hi Mannat. <br>
    You found this. I'm writing this at 11.48PM while hiding from my mom so I can get something done for you before this year is over :) <br>
    Today.. was the best day of my life. I have never felt so safe, cared for, LOVED FOR, in my entire life, and I only and only have you to thank for it. <br>
    In just barely a month, you have changed my life so fucking much and flipped it upside down and made it the best it's ever been. <br>
    The kiss, the KISS, I cannot stop thinking about it. Me looking at you and you looking drop-dead gorgeous. Me getting lost in your eyes, pinning you to the wall, kissing you. <br>
    You've driven me crazy with love, and I love you so fucking much for it Mannat. I'll always be here, and I hope you will be too. I Love you.
