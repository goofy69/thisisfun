you stick with me
2022 was so horrible
but i still feel so lucky
you're the one who i thought of
whenever i was down and too tired 
you're the one who gets me the most flustered
the best thing, none of us are liars
we both are the splitting images
of who we never knew
and somehow when we talk
it never feels as if it's new
i love you so so much
you're the reason i felt so free
the fact that i knew i wouldn't mess up
fuck, you're my everything
i am really bad with poems
and plus i am speedrunning ;-;
but be with me forever
i promise you this will be it
i hope we spend our lifetimes together
don't mind me if i'm clingy
2023 will be the best with you by my side
i feel like what we have is gonna blossom into something pretty
let's stay together forever
please say yes ;-;
the best thing ever is that we 
accept each other even if we are a mess</pre>
