            like the stars in the night sky
            you stick with me
            2022 was so horrible
            but i still feel so lucky
            you're the one who i thought of
            whenever i was down and too tired 
            you're the one who gets me the most flustered
            the best thing, none of us are liars
            we both are the splitting images
            of who we never knew
            and somehow when we talk
            it never feels as if it's new
            i love you so so much
            you're the reason i felt so free
            the fact that i knew i wouldn't mess up
            fuck, you're my everything
            i am really bad with poems
            and plus i am speedrunning ;-;
            but be with me forever
            i promise you this will be it
            i hope we spend our lifetimes together
            don't mind me if i'm clingy
            2023 will be the best with you by my side
            i feel like what we have is gonna blossom into something pretty
            let's stay together forever
            please say yes ;-;
            the best thing ever is that we 
            accept each other even if we are a mess
